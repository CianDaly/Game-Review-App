## Backend (Optional).

. . . . . There is no backend functionality implemented for this app . . . . . .  

## Authentication (Optional).

. . . There is no user authentication implemented for this app. . .

## Independent learning.

 Researched how to build and deploy my app to a domain on the internet. The app is hosted and deployed on Surge to view it as an end user would on the internet.
 I watched a tutorial of how to use Firebase for user authentiaction for a sign-up and login process but was unable to implement this fully due to time contrainsts.
